\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

 Demonstrate that the additional capabilities of the Rubin Science
Platform necessary to support DP0.2 have been deployed on the Interim
Data Facility (IDF). ~May be demonstrated with the DC2 DP0.2 dataset
itself or with a dataset of equivalent complexity, e.g., an HSC
reprocessing.\\[2\baselineskip]DP0.2 expectations are as described in
\href{https://rtn-001.lsst.io/}{RTN-001} and
\href{https://rtn-004.lsst.io/}{RTN-004} . The key difference in RSP
capabilities from DP0.1 is the availability of IVOA-compatible image
metadata services and image services in the API Aspect, and the addition
to the Portal Aspect of specific search capabilities for ObsCore image
metadata searches in an ObsTAP service.\\[2\baselineskip]Because of
issues with passing authorization tokens through PyVO, for the purposes
of LDM-503-RSPa the API Aspect services are verified indirectly, though
the Portal Aspect.\\[2\baselineskip]A supplementary verification of
their usability through the Notebook Aspect and externally will have to
be performed. ~See LVV-T2678.



\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

 Tested on the IDF at data.lsst.cloud, in Safari 15.6.1 under macOS
11.6.8, based on the DP0.2 dataset.

\subsection{Overall Assessment}
\label{sect:overallassessment}

Generally successfully. ~No test steps failed.\\[2\baselineskip]Lack of
support for easy symbolic selection of filter bands was noted, but band
selection was still possible, either by wavelength, or by symbolic
selection via the ``constraints field''. This is expected to be remedied
during the remaining life of DP0.2.\\[2\baselineskip]Lack of pixel-based
distance measurements on images prevented the expected verification of
DMS-PRTL-REQ-0085. (This appears to be a recent regression, as this
functionality was previously available.)\\[2\baselineskip]5 other bugs
were reported against the Portal, mostly minor usability issues, with
one affecting the format of downloaded FITS files. 7 additional tickets
were filed for suggested improvements.\\[2\baselineskip]One ticket was
filed against the pipelines regarding ``warning''-level verification
problems with FITS files.\\[2\baselineskip]Outside the scope of this
test as written: it was impossible to conveniently test the API Aspect
image services directly because of a lack of a good recipe for supplying
authorization tokens to the image services. ~This affects their
usability externally as well as from the Notebook Aspect. ~This should
be a focus of usability work on PyVO and on possible ``convenience''
wrapper functions between now and ComCam operation.

\subsection{Recommended Improvements}
\label{sect:recommendations}

In image query, prioritize improving filter-band
selection.\\[2\baselineskip]In image display, beyond the specific issues
filed, revisit performance: add in-progress indications to slow
operations that don't currently have them, like mask display and the
changing of stretch functions. ~Investigate the speed of mask display
and of initial loading of HiPS images.

\section{Detailed Test Results}
\label{sect:detailedtestresults}

\subsection{Test Cycle LVV-C167 }

Open test cycle {\it \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testrun/LVV-C167}{LDM-503-RSPa: Test RSP capabilities on IDF for DP0.2 readiness}} in Jira.

Test Cycle name: LDM-503-RSPa: Test RSP capabilities on IDF for DP0.2 readiness\\
Status: Done

This test cycle contains the tests necessary to verify the readiness of
the RSP as redeployed on the IDF to meet the needs of the DP0.2
exercise, essentially repeating tests previously carried out on the NCSA
RSP deployments. ~This test cycle builds on LVV-C166, including only the
test cases necessary to verify additional capabilities needed for DP0.2,
essentially all associated with image and image metadata searches in the
API and Portal Aspects.

Execution status: {\bf Initial Pass }

Final comment:\\It was possible to carry out all the required test steps, almost all
fully successfully. ~A few steps had ``pass with deviation'' status.
~Tickets have been filed for all of these. ~Regarding Firefly, 4 are
bugs, 1 is a planned feature that has not yet been implemented, and 5
are suggested improvements, mainly to UX. ~An additional ticket about
warnings in FITS file verification has been filed for Science Pipelines,
and seems to be a known issue.

DataLink links service response available through the Firefly
UI.\\[2\baselineskip]The ``save button'' version had three verification
errors, regarding the presence of the ``TFIELDS'' header in each image
extension. What \_appears\_ to have happened is that Firefly's
underlying FITS library (a combination of Starlink and nom.tam.fits)
failed to remove this header when uncompressing the originally
compressed image extensions.\\[2\baselineskip]Comments:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  This error should be fixed, perhaps by updating to a newer version of
  nom.tam.fits, or perhaps by modifying Firefly-specific code.
\item
  Rubin's processed image files (PVIs, diffims, coadd tiles) are so
  large that it is problematic that Firefly provides them only in their
  decompressed form. ~These files are natively around 100MB and they are
  nearly doubling in size when uncompressed.
\item
  It is part of the longer-term design that direct access to downloading
  files from the image services should be possible through the Portal,
  which would bypass this. ~This is related to the requirement to
  download selected data from an image metadata table
  (DMS-PRTL-REQ-0112).
\item
  Other warning-level problems are reported by fitsverify in both the
  direct download and the via-Firefly download.

\item
  The exact pixel frame of the rectangle on the image, in pixel
  coordinates, is not reported, but would be useful for downstream use
  and/or reproducibility.
\item
  The coordinates reported are always in equatorial sexagesimal,
  regardless of the settings of the associated image display; this is
  surprising UX and makes the tool harder to use in some contexts.
\item
  It would be useful to provide pixel coordinates of the four identified
  locations, in FITS or zero-based coordinates as configured for the

\item
  The tool doesn't follow the contemporary Firefly convention of making
  coordinates uniformly available for copy-to-clipboard via an icon.

  an image histogram from this dialog would be most useful.
